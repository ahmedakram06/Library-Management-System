# Library-Management-System

This is a console-based Library Management System implemented in C++, demonstrating how to manage book records using a Hash Map with Universal Hashing to reduce collisions. The system allows users to insert, update, delete, and display records of books stored in memory.

## Features

- Add multiple book records
- Update book details by ISSN
- Delete book records
- View all records
- Unique ISSN used as book identifier
- Universal Hashing to reduce collisions
- All records stored in RAM using STL containers (vector, list)

## Getting Started 

- Clone this repository in your local machine
- Windows (due to _getch() and conio.h dependency)
- Run on any C++ compiler (e.g., Visual Studio, Dev C++)

## Menu Options

Once the program starts, use the following keys:

- C	 -  Create new book records
- R	 -  Review (display) all records
- U  -  Update a specific book by ISSN
- D  -  Delete a book record by ISSN
- Q  -  Quit the program
